        We have initiated skill development programs for ladies from slum areas
        and the transgender community. We teach them skills such as sewing,
        cutting, cooking, etc. so they can become self sufficient and
        contributing members of the society.

        We frequently establish medical camps around the poor community to
        provide them free medical checkups and give them medicine or treatment
        where necessary. The patients are also given talks on the importance of
        cleanliness and healthy lifestyle.

        We often prepare food for hundreds of people. Then we select slum areas
        and distribute the food or find deserving people and bring them to a
        dastarkhwan to serve them food. This is also a good opportunity to teach
        them manners and give them dawah.

        We build vocational centers for boys and girls where they are taught
        tailoring, electric work, computer skills, and more. These centers aim
        to develop bread-earning capabilities in young children. This has now
        evolved into a charity school by the grace of Allah.
