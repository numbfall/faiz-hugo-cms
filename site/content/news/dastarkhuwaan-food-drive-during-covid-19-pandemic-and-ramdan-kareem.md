## Distribution of ration bags during Corona pandemic

During the hard time of Corona pandemic, Faiz-e-Aam trust distributed hundreds of ration bags among the families of daily wagers and low-salaried workers, who were not able to earn their living due to the lock down.

## Distribution of ration bags during Ramadan

Ration packs are distributed throughout ramadan among deserving families within Pindi/Islamabad. A proper validation process is observed so that the donation reaches only genuine people. Friends and family members are involved to identify needy people in their surroundings. Many a times, ration is sent to the familyâ€™s doorsteps without letting them know.

## New way to distribute ration packs during Corona pandemic

Keeping the virus safety measures in mind, ration packs are laid on roads so that needy people may come and take as much as they require, without coming in touch with our volunteer workers. The whole process is monitored until all packs are collected.

## Free roti project

A creative way was practiced to help the underprivileged families and daily wagers during Corona pandemic! We selected some tandoors near slum areas and construction sites where we deposited sadqa and asked the tandoor owners to provide free roti and salan to any mason or needy person who comes to them. This project was monitored daily by our volunteers.

## Helping the Transgender Community!

Transgenders are an integral and most downtrodden part of our community. Reaching out and helping them is imperative for whoever can... specially during difficult time of the lockdown. Faiz-e-Aam Trust makes special efforts to reach out and help the transgender community during Covid-19 lockdown and the holy month of Ramadan.

## Aftaari boxes

During the holy month of Ramzan, hundreds of Aftaari boxes are prepared and distributed every day before maghrib time at sites where masons work all day under the heat of sun, while they fast.

The box contains a full meal with dates and a fruit. Each box costs Rs. 150

## Eidee project

Some cash amount will be handed over to masons, daily wagers and low salaried staff before they go home to their villages on Eid. This envelope of happiness will surely bring smiles on the faces of their loved ones.
