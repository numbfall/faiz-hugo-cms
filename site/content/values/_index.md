      It all started from under a tree. Open-air classes were conducted in
      different sectors of Islamabad, where underprivileged children would be
      given free education and food, which got them off the streets. This kept
      on going for four years until we were able to rent a proper building for
      Mount Hira School in 2012.

      Reach to the deprived sectors of society. Find the people there and
      provide them with free education, training, food, healthcare and basic
      necessities in order to produce good citizens and contributing human
      beings.

      Is to create lasting solutions to poverty, hunger, ignorance and illness.
      Resulting in general happiness of the society and a promising future for
      our children.
